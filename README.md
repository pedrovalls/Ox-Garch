# Ox-Garch
OxMetrics batch codes for Engle's test for conditional heteroskedasticity and for estimating Univariate GARCH Models.

The Models are: ARCH(1), GARCH(1,1), EGARCH(1,1) and GJR(1,1).

All distributions are considered: Normal, Symmetric Student-t, GED and Skew Student-t.

Also NGARCH is estimated without the last 10 observations and out-of-sample forecast is done.

Plot the forecast for the conditional mean and also with the V@R(0.025) and V@R(0.975).
